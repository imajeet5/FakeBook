Authentication process has some flaws that need to be fixed

## Setup

Just run npm install by going in `client` and `backend-api` folder.  
You need to create a .env file of this format.

```
CONNECTIONSTRING=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.qyvsy.mongodb.net/<projectName>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
PORT=8080
JWTSECRET=yourJWTSecret

```
